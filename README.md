# simple-kube

`simple-kube` aims to install Kubernetes not depend on any private or banned resources.

## Install your cluster

### Run simple-kube in container

To run the playbook without any preparation,

```
bash <(curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kitt1987/simple-kubernetes/master/run/simple-kube.sh)
```

It is optional to mount the Docker socket to the container.  See remaining sections.

## Run the playbook

We've generated an SSH key pair in the container. You can install it on hosts outlined in the inventory. Or, generate your key pairs for security. 

To install a cluster,

```
ansible-playbook -i inventory/sample deploy-cluster.yml
```

To clean an installation,

```
ansible-playbook -i inventory/sample clean-cluster.yml
```

Once failures arose before installation get done, clean the cluster would restore stale hosts.

### Resources cache for completely on-premise hosts

In on-premise environments, `simple-kube` can't download images or configurations from the Internet. `simple-kube` provides a simple way to collect and cache these resources. 

Once you mount the local Docker socket `/var/run/docker.sock` to the `simple-kube` container, it will cache all the downloaded images and configurations in the container after the first complete installation. Then, you can commit the container and use the new image on-prem.

```
docker commit -m "kubernetes version v1.12.9" -p simple-kube kitt0hsu/simple-kube:v1.12.9
```

## Dependencies

### From the Internet

`simple-kube` will download some binaries and images. Some of them could be quite slow. In **MainLand China**, I strongly recommend you download the binaries below manually, and specify the substitutes in the inventory. 

* Kubernetes releases from https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes and https://dl.k8s.io
* CNI plugins releases from https://github.com/containernetworking/plugins
* Docker from docker.com
* Image `quay.io/coreos/etcd:v3.2.18` from https://quay.io/
* Image `coredns/coredns` from Docker Hub and its configuration from GitHub

### From package repositories of distros

`simple-kube`  also installs some packages on hosts while installing clusters. Most of them could be found in the official package repository of each distro. They are,

* rsync
* jq
